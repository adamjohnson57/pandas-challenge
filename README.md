Analysis
•	The most obvious and clear results that the data shows are that the charter schools unequivocally outperformed their district school counterparts when it came to those students that were able to pass both the math tests and the reading tests. The eight charter schools all had overall passing rates of 89%-91%, while the seven district schools in the data set were in the 52%-54% range of passing. 

•	Looking more specifically between the reading and math scores, charter schools had nearly identical math and reading scores, while the district schools clearly show a more drastic drop off in terms of their student’s math scores in comparison. The district schools’ math scores lagged by 6.5 points against the charter schools’ average, and though the reading scores of the district schools were also lower, they performed much more closely to the charter schools performance with a fewer than three point differential.

•	Most surprising in the data was the fact that the more money available in the school budget’s per student resulted in lower test scores across the board and decreased incrementally within that framework. 

•	Also worth noting is the stagnation in the test scores over the course of the four years of school, regardless of school type, as each of the grades fall in close proximity within each school.
